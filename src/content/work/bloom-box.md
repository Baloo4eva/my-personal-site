<a href="https://temp-conversion-five.vercel.app/"> Temperature Conversion </a> was one of my first coding projects where I learned to use tools like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Vercel. The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience combining JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while also exploring basic terminal commands, working with GitHub, and leveraging Vercel to streamline deployment times.
