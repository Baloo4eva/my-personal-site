<a href="https://temp-conversion-five.vercel.app/"> Temperature conversion</a> is one of my first coding projects where I learned how to utilize tools such as Visual Studio Code, GitHub and Vercel. The purpose of this project was to experience first hand first to combine JS, HTML and CSS. As well as exploring simple terminal commands, exploring Github and utilizing Vercel to expedite deployment times.
