					<p>
						With over seven years of experience in B2B SaaS environments, 
						I specialize in client lifecycle management, product adoption, and retention 
						for Enterprise accounts across startups and global organizations. 
						In my most recent role as a Client Experience Manager at Uptycs, I primarily 
						supported Enterprise customers in protecting their cloud infrastructure, 
						developer tools, and CI/CD pipeline processes. I’ve had the privilege of working with 
						customers worldwide, with a specialization in U.S. and LATAM territories.
					</p>
					<p>
						Born and raised in Santiago, Chile, I had the privilege of attending the International School Nido de Aguilas from K-12. 
						There, I developed a passion for Economics, History, Math, and Sciences, earning IB certificates in each. I was also active 
						in sports and played on the Varsity Soccer team.

					<p>
						From a young age, I've had a passion for the unknown and problem-solving, which has taught me that there’s always something new to learn every day.
						Since young I have had a passion for the unknown and problem solving, which as taught me we all can learn something new everyday.
